/*
To declare a constant or unchanging variable, use const instead of let. They cannot be changed and
an attempt to do so would cause an error. There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases
for difficult-to-remember values that are known prior to execution. Such constants are named using
capital letters and underscores. Constants not known prior to execution are named normally.

const DAY = 'Monday';
const COLOR_ORANGE = '#FF7F00';

// Picking a colour
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;

// Normally named constants
